  <h2 id='THE' class='c004'><span class='large'>THE</span><br /> REGULATING<br /> Silver Coin, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Writing on so curious, and
intricate a Subject, I
have great Reason to
bespeak the Candour of the Reader.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Book of this Nature cannot but
expect to meet with great Opposition,
and ’tis very probable from Two sorts
of Men especially, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> Those that know
little of the Subject-Matter, and those
that know much.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>They that know little are Jealous, and
they that know much Opiniatre, and
whilst one will not take Pains to
comprehend a thing, another taketh
too much to overthrow it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Mr.</i> Lowndes.</div>

<p class='c000'>But as I hope I shall say nothing
here, to be pity’d; so I am on the other
side pretty secure from Envy, because,
the greatest Credit that can be
gotten, by a thing of this Nature, doth
already seem to be engross’d by a late
learned and industrious Writer
upon this Subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, I must needs say, a prudent
piece of Service the <i>Lords of the Treasury</i>
did the Nation, and more particularly
the <i>Parliament</i>, under whose
Judgment this matter justly falls, by
imploying so able a Pen to clear the
way, in giving a true, and entertaining
Account of Matter of Fact.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>But I must do my self that little
piece of Justice too, as to acknowledge
the main Design of these Papers was
laid before I could have a sight of
that Book:</p>

<p class='c000'>And now I am ready enough to
confess my own Weakness, and Insufficiency,
for so great an Undertaking;
nor do I pretend to write a Stile equal
to that experienc’d Minister, but am
contented to be understood without
shining, and to offer Mathematical
Reasoning, without polishing and Ornament.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I at first form’d the whole
Scheme, I had more Leisure, by much,
than when I put it in Writing, and I
can better answer for my Design, than
for my way of expressing it; and therefore
all the Favour I expect or ask, is,
that the <i>Theorem</i>, which is the main of
the Work, may not suffer for the Inartificialness
of the <i>Problems</i> that lead to it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>I affect Truth and Plainness, and a
sincere Love to my Country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatsoever I have read or heard on
this Subject, hath brought the Matters
to this <i>Dilemma</i>, that either Coin must
want of its intrinsic Value, so as to
disatisfie most of the King’s loving
Subjects, and endanger a fatal stop to
Trade; or if it is to be made of near
an intrinsic Value, according to the
Rate Silver shall go at in the time
of Coining, then upon every little
Rise of Silver higher than that Price,
we are in danger of having it exported
and melted down; and so every
Parliament may meet with the
same Difficulties we at present labour
under in the badness and scarcity of Silver
Coin.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>That which I pretend to, is, to obviate
both these Dangers, or otherwise
I confess I might have spar’d my Pains;
for he who hath provided for one and
not the other, hath at the best but
done <i>half the Work</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are three Terms of Value, upon
the right Understanding of which,
much depends, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> <i>Extrinsic</i>, <i>Intrinsic</i>,
<i>Real</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h2 id='DEFINITIONS' class='c004'>DEFINITIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'><i>Extrinsic Value</i> of Money is the
Denomination and Power, that is
given it by Authority.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Intrinsic Value</i> is the necessary and
Natural Value, always and every where
inherent in the Species.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Real Value</i> is a Certain Value more
or less than Extrinsic, or Intrinsic, adherent
to the Species, with respect to
time and place.</p>

<p class='c000'>TWO things are now under Consideration.
1. The Badness of our Silver
Coin.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The Scarcity of it.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 id='I' class='c004'>CHAP. I.<br /> <span class='large'><i>Of the present badness of our Coin.</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>By Current Coin, I mean not
that which is Current by Law,
but by Custom; that which People
are forc’d to take for want of better,
to the great Grievance of the Subject,
Dishonour of the Kingdom, and Obstruction
of Trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>For every Man now is destitute of
a sufficient Pledge and Security for his
Personal Estate, unless he will take
Personal Security, or find out a Mortgage,
or rely upon a Bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Personal Security is now less than ever,
the publick Banks have so drain’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>or so engag’d at least the Traders in
Money.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mortgages are very hard to be
found, for small Summs, and much harder
for great ones, since the establishment
of the new Banks.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as for a sole reliance on the Credit
of the new Banks I leave that for
other Heads to discuss; I am of the
Opinion it was never intended that
they should be the only Security for
Personal Estates, and that People should
carry in their Money to ’em out of necessity,
and not choice.</p>

<p class='c000'>And how dishonourable it is to the
King and Kingdom that our Money
should be so suddenly debased to such
a shameful Degree, foreign States will
soon determine:</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that it doth not become so
by publick Authority but by Connivence
of the Sovereignty, or Necessities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of the Nation, is not stating the thing
at all less Dishonourably.</p>

<p class='c000'>For Connivence at a Fault discovers
either an Ignorance of it, or Inability
to correct it, or design in making use
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>’Tis plain enough the Government
is not Ignorant of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>His Majesty in His Speech to both
Houses of Parliament, shews He hath
no design in making use of it, because
He recommends the redressing of it to
their Consideration, and therefore the
not redressing it, can be only imputable
to the Weakness and Poverty of
the State:</p>

<p class='c000'>And what Inferences, not only the
<i>French</i>, but all other Politicians may
draw from thence are very obvious.</p>

<p class='c000'>The finest Clothes that our Soldiers
can put on, in the Field, would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>at all dazzle the Eyes of the Confederate
Princes, nor strike any despondencies
into the Minds of our Enemies,
if they shall all come to know that
the whole Power of <i>England</i> is at this
time held up by the imaginary Value of
<i>Birmingham</i> half Crowns and Shillings.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will hearten our Enemies, and
discourage our Friends, very much,
when they shall come to know that
the Nummary Wealth of <i>England</i> is almost
vanish’d, the Silver Coin gone,
and the Royal Mint at a stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>No Body will believe that we
can long subsist at this rate; and
indeed ’tis impossible we should, for
if ’tis now much harder to redress than
it was a year ago, and that means cannot
be yet found out to do it, what
Hopes shall we have of ever doing it
’till the War is ended? and what
Hopes shall we have of bringing our
Enemies to Terms, whilst they are sensible
of our great Poverty.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The only way, sure, to bring the
<i>French</i> King to Reason, will be by
shewing him we are Able to continue
the War as long as he can possibly
be Willing, which he can never believe,
so long as he sees our Money,
by which he judges our Wealth to be
imaginary only, and not real Silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides all this, we are in apparent
Danger hereby of being more effectually
and suddenly ruin’d by our
Friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>For if this Sessions of Parliament
should break up without regulating
the Coin, what Consequences may possibly
ensue?</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not impossible that Foreigners
in all parts of <i>Christendom</i> should immediately
set themselves to counterfeit our
base Money.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>There are beyond Seas as good
Chymists, and Black-Smiths as at <i>London</i>,
or <i>Birmingham</i>, and ’tis not impossible
that they should secretly Import
as much base Money, resembling that
which goes current among us, and
which hath not the intrinsic Value
of One Shilling in Three, as if they
please may not only buy up and Export
Two or Three Millions Worth
of our Staple Commodities, affording
’em Cheaper abroad than we can at
home; but as much Worth of our
imported Commodities, even Gold it
self, if they like that Trade better.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such an Importation of Money
would I fear, be of worse Consequence
than all our Exportation of Silver and
Gold can prove.</p>

<hr class='c006' />

<p class='c000'>If what cost our Merchants a Shilling,
they should sell for a Groat, or
if they shall buy of us an Ounce of
Gold for Three or Four Ounces of
Silver, or supposing ’em to buy it at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> <i>per</i> Ounce, they shall buy an
Ounce for as much Counterfeit Money
as shall not have 7 Peny-Weight
of true Bullion in it, this would give
our Balance of Trade, such a Terrible
Swing, as no true Hearted <i>English-Man</i>
would be willing to see.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a Danger which the easiness
and small Charge of counterfeiting old
Clipp’d Money threatens very much,
unless it be speedily cry’d down.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in the mean time, let us consider
the Condition of the other Coin among
us, not counterfeited, but Clipp’d,
fil’d, or otherwise diminish’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>’Tis plainly demonstrable by the
Receipts of Money in His Majesty’s
Exchequer, that one half of the Silver
is already Clipp’d away, and there is
no Security why half what remains
wo’nt be taken off too.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The Laws are severe enough made,
and put in Execution, and yet <i>New-Gate</i>
is perhaps now as full of Clippers
as it was Three or Four Years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing but a Sense of Religion doth
restrain Men from profitable Sins, and
the <i>Ordinary</i> of <i>New-Gate</i> can inform
us, how little the Guilt of Clipping
affects the Criminal’s Conscience.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor will preaching do much Good,
upon those that never come to Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clipping is the gainfulest Sin that
ever was invented, and sits the easiest
upon the Sinner’s Mind, and ’tis never
to be remedied but by making it
impracticable, which Mill’d Money
only (and no other to be current)
can do.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what a perpetual Discontent and
Confusion must it end in, if People
shall come at last to proffer a Groat
for a Shilling?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>This must increase still vastly the
Value of Guineas; this must raise the
Price of all Commodities, this must
make it impossible to expect any Money
at all, either for the King’s Use,
or Balance of Trade; and this will
not only force us to recall our Troops
from <i>Flanders</i>, and by a natural Consequence
let in the War upon us,
but it would put a sudden and
universal stop to all Foreign Trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what fatal Consequences may it
have in the mean time at home let us
consider.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may very well be suppos’d that
a Dragooner may proffer to a Corn-Chandler
2 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> for a Bushel of Oats,
and that the Corn-Chandler seeing that
there is not Three Peny <i>wt.</i> or 9 Peny
worth of Silver in both the Shillings,
should not like the Bargain, what’s now
to be done?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Should There be a Law with Penalty
for refusing clipp’d Coin, as
there is for crack’d Six-pences, this
would encourage Clippers to leave nothing
remaining in a Shilling but the
Figure XII.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the Law prohibit the passing of
all Silver clipp’d within the Ring, than
two Thirds of the present Money of
<i>England</i> would be immediately cry’d
down: Then the Loss of clipp’d as well
as counterfeit Money would be very
hard upon the Proprietors, and we should
have two Thirds less Money for carrying
on our Trade:</p>

<p class='c000'>And now we have two Thirds less
than we should have, and if that two
Thirds, which is cry’d down at the
Owner’s Loss, should be carry’d to the
Mint, and new coin’d, it would scarce
yield a twelfth Part of what we should
then want.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>If the Law should put down all Silver
Money but of such a Weight, then certainly
all Money above that Weight
would be clipp’d down to it, and every
Man must carry a pair of Scales in his
Pocket, and we are still subject to the
Consequence of the former Paragraph,
as that former Paragraph would be to
the first Conclusion of this, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> <i>That all
Money would be soon clipp’d down to the publick
Standard.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Let the matter be canvas’d never so
much, it must at last come to this Conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>We cannot subsist either in War or Peace if
the Coin of</i> England <i>be not speedily regulated</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h2 id='II' class='c004'>CHAP. II.<br /> <span class='large'><i>Of the present</i> Scarcity <i>of Silver Coin in</i> England.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Now let us consider, that if all the
current Silver Coin of <i>England</i>
were passable and unalterable, yet we
have vastly too little in Tale for carrying
on the Trade of the Nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this will appear several Ways,
but chiefly by the high Price or Guineas
and the Causes thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Guineas have risen from 21 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> to
30 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> either because the intrinsic Value
of Gold hath risen near in Proportion
to the Diminution of the intrinsic Value
of Silver Coin, or by reason of the
Scarcity of the Silver Coin, or the Uncertainty
of it, or partly by Reason of one,
and partly t’other, which I believe is the
Truth, that the Badness and Scarcity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Silver Coin hath occasioned an extravagant
Rise of Gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now if so much as concerns the Scarcity
of Silver be granted me, then I have
nothing to do upon this Article, but shew
that the present high Price of Gold is dangerous
to the Nation, and more dangerous
will a farther Advance of the Price
thereof be.</p>

<p class='c000'>And to them who think the Badness
of our Coin the greatest Reason of the
present high Valuation of Gold, I shall
in the mean time say, that if the Price of
Gold hath risen, suppose 4 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> or 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> in a
Guinea, upon the Account only of the
Baseness of our Silver Coin; then in handling
that Notion we must look upon
Gold not so much a Coin as a Commodity,
and so indeed it is at this Present;
because the Price of Gold in the
Oar or Ingott hath risen almost proportionably
to that which is coin’d; so that
a Man doth not take a Guinea rather
than 29 clipp’d Shillings, because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>King’s Impress is upon it; for so ’tis
upon the Shillings; or because Authority
has made it pass so, for that Authority
is wanting; but because it is of a
greater intrinsic Value than is in 29 Shillings
of clipp’d or counterfeit Money,
which is now most current: So that the
Valuation of the Commodity Gold
hath encreased as the intrinsic Value of
our Silver Coin hath decreased.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if so, then it is to be suspected
that the Price of all staple Commodities
have encreased in equal Proportion, or
that they are in such a Proportion now
higher than they wou’d have been; for
Gold and Silver being reciprocally the
Standards and Measures of Proportion of
one another, are so of every thing else;
and if I can now buy as many Ounces
and Peny-Weights of Silver for a
Guinea, as I could have done formerly,
then is not Silver Risen more than<a id='t20'></a>
Gold: and if I can buy as many
Grains of Gold now with an Ounce
of Silver as I could formerly, then is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Gold risen more than Silver. And this is,
perhaps more than a Supposition: For
when Silver was 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> an Ounce, I cou’d
buy 4 Ounces 6 Peny-wt. with a Guinea,
and so I can now, that Silver is 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i>
<i>per</i> Ounce. Again when Gold was about
3 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> 14 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> an Ounce, I cou’d buy an Ounce
of Gold with 15 Ounces of Silver, and so
I can now, or near the Matter: So that
the Commodities of Gold and Silver answer
one another as they did, or near
thereabout, abating only for the Portableness
of Gold and its Coinage; whereas
no Coinage is now allowable for those
Pieces of Silver wherein the Coinage is
defaced and spoiled; and if those two
Commodities are so much higher than
they would have been: For they are the
Measure and Rule of Proportion of all.
Then when the Value of Gold and
Silver rises, the intrinsic Value of all
Commodities rise with ’em:</p>

<p class='c000'>For suppose an <i>Eastland</i> or <i>Hamburgh</i> Merchant
brings over a Barrel of Mum, which
he (when our Money was old Standard)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>sold for 3 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> he disliking our Money now,
sells his Mum, not according to the extrinsic
Valuation of our Money, which is
risen since he was here last; because
the Intrinsic is diminished, but according
to the common Value of Gold and Silver
in the World; and therefore requires now
4 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> because he judges our Silver to be a
fourth Part worse than it was, or if at
5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> he judges it to be 2 Parts in 5 worse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, suppose he sells his Mum for
Gold, or is to exchange his Silver for
Gold, that which he was wont to sell for
3 Guineas, he expects 3 Guineas for still;
or if you are to pay him in Silver, he expects
as much as he can change for 3
Guineas, he wo’nt be fobb’d off with
less: So the Merchant sells as cheap as
ever; but we pay more, because what
we pay, is dearer than it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>You’ll object against this way of reasoning,
and say ’tis the Risques of the
Sea, and Obstructions of Trade now in
Time or War, makes all foreign Commodities
dearer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>But I hope I don’t err in saying, that
the Merchant notwithstanding the War
wou’d take less of our Silver Coin for
the same Commodities if it were better,
and less Gold of us if it wou’d
buy as much Silver in his own Country.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there are Reasons which may
ballance the Dangers of the Seas in
Times of War in Reference to our
Commerce with the Subjects of Neutral
Princes.</p>

<p class='c000'>On our side Taxes are great, and the
Subject cannot afford to buy so many
foreign Commodities as at other times:
And on their side they have not so good
a Vent as they had; so their Commodities
must stick on hand unless sold so cheap
as may make amends for the Hazards of
the Sea, and the Cheapness of Commodities
wou’d be the natural Effects of
Scarcity of Money, if our Money had
the same real Value as formerly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Again a Collier who trades to <i>Newcastle</i>
is wont to receive a Guinea for every
Chaldron of Coals he brought into
the River at such a Time of Year, and
so he doth still, and no more; and who
can say Coals are risen and Mum is
risen? No such thing; but Gold and
Silver are risen: And when we give
the same Gold and Silver for a Commodity
as we did, we wrongfully say the
Commodity is dear, when ’tis not that
but the Gold and Silver which costs
us more. We give the same Labour,
the same Leather, the same Mault, for
the same Quantity of Gold and Silver
which we did.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now ’tis the Country Gentlemen,
Artizans and Day-Labourers have
the hardest Bargain of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Farmer sells his own Corn and
Cattle according to the Value of Gold
and Silver, and the Mercer his Silks,
and the Draper his Cloth, and the
Tanner his Leather; but the Farmer in
the mean time pays his Rent, and Husbandmen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and Artizans, according to
the Value of our present Coin, and
when he paid 28 Guineas a Quarter
formerly, twenty shall serve turn now;
and the Scrivener buys the Country
Gentlemen’s Lands, according to the
Valuation of Coin; and not Metal;
and the Land which cost the Father
600 Guineas, is now sold by the Son
for 430; and half a Year hence it may
be proffered for 300. This is nothing
but Ruine and Confusion to the Landed
Men of the Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the Buyers of Land, as the Merchants,
Bankers and Scriveners are, were
Sellers too, we should find Land rise in
Proportion to every thing else.</p>

<p class='c000'>And whereas you’ll say that Farmers
and Grasiers are no Merchants, and
wou’d be as well contented with passable
Coin as old Standard, ’tis very true, but
they keep up to such Prices as their
whole-sale Chapmen can afford to
give ’em; and when a Factor sells his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Cloth at <i>Blackwell-Hall</i>; he considers
the Necessity of the Buyer, as well as Expence
of the Clothier; when a Merchant
can make a better Profit, ’tis expected
he should give a better Price.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this with some unthinking
People is the Effect of War; and because
some things are dearer upon this
Account than others, therefore every
thing else that is dearer must have the
same Cause assigned; but a general
Cheapness of things should, methinks, be
the Natural Effect of our War, if our
Money with which we go to Market
were as it should be.</p>

<p class='c000'>The War consumes but little of our
Product and Manufacture; it carries a
great many Mouthes into <i>Flanders</i>, and
that would naturally make Provisions
cheap: Many of these Mouths had idle
Hands, and so they are not miss’d in the
Manufacture; but instead of them, a
great many industrious Foreigners come
among us who eat little and work
much.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The Taxes, as I said, are great Inducements
to Frugality, and the Advantages
People have of late made of Money,
have been no less.</p>

<p class='c000'>These and other such like things if
the Price of Gold and Silver had not risen,
must have occasion’d a Fall of most
other Commodities.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now let us consider the Danger
of the high Price of Gold as it stands at
present.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coin is the most portable Commodity,
and Gold the most portable Coin;
but we have run it up high, and therefore
do’nt at present fear Exportation; but
then, if ’tis considerably higher than among
our Neighbours, there is great Reason
to fear too great an Importation may
be as dangerous, as a disadvantagious one
doth already prove.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems to me so curious and nice a
Commodity that always there may be
Danger in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>If in the great Thirst that’s now upon
us, we take in too much that will occasion
a still more dangerous Rise of Silver:
For considering the present Balance of
Trade, the more Gold is imported, the
less there will be of Silver; and if we
import too little, we leave our selves destitute
of a Way of Trading.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if the Gold which is our present
Support, should by the Craft of Foreigners,
or necessities of the War follow the
Silver out of the Nation, we should be
left, I doubt in a very bad Condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if its Value should rise, as it must
needs do if the Silver Coin grow worse
and worse, then by how much it rises, by
so much more all the Inconveniences
and Dangers of its late Rise among us
will encrease.</p>

<p class='c000'>What those Dangers are at present is
no great Mystery, the <i>English</i> Merchants
will make none of it if they may be heard.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The melancholly Letters which their
Factors abroad daily send ’em makes the
Case plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>That a Guinea in <i>Holland</i> and <i>Flanders</i>
is now but 26 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> or to speak more
properly and plainly too, so many Rials,
or Dolars and Stivers as bear Proportion
to 26 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> of our Money.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that Rate they there buy our Guineas
of Officers, which they can’t be hindered
carrying over in their Pockets; then
the <i>Holland</i> and <i>Flemming</i> Merchants send
back to us the same Guineas to buy
therewith our Staple Goods and Manufactures.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they are received at 30 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> And
their Factors here, who buy our Manufactures
as cheap of the Clothier or
Stocking-Seller as our own Merchants,
send back for 1000 Guineas. (for Instance)
Received from <i>Holland</i> 1500
Pounds worth of our Goods, which when
the <i>Dutch</i> or <i>Flemming</i> Merchant receives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>he finds by his Accompts that these Goods
stand him in no more than 1300 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> So that
he has received beyond Sea the like
Goods for 1300, <i>&amp;c.</i> which hath stood
our <i>English</i> Merchant in 1500 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> The
<i>English</i> and <i>Flemming</i> Merchants then ship
off each their Goods for <i>Spain</i>, <i>Turkey</i>, the
<i>East</i> or <i>West-Indies</i>, and there they go
to Market to sell these Goods, and the
<i>Flemming</i> under-sells the <i>English</i> 13 <i>per
Cent.</i> even in these Commodities which
are the Product of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now what is the plain Inference?
but inevitable Ruine to the whole Trade
of the Nation. Here’s an End of Merchandise,
and (in Time of Peace) all Use
of Shipping.</p>

<p class='c000'>This I think is the natural and the
present Effect of the Rise of Guineas.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return to my proper Subject,
fare it as it will with Gold, the current
Silver Coin of <i>England</i> is, by 3 Parts in
5 too little for our In-Land Trade, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>must ruine in Process of time all those
Traders who are wont to make several
Returns of their Money in a Year;
for the Scarcity of Money occasions
the giving of longer Credit than is
usual, and the giving of Credit hinders
the Frequency of Returns.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the Want of Silver Coin occasions
the taking of Gold at such
high Rates; and the Value of Gold
Coin being uncertain, which Silver
Coin hath not hitherto been, the Receiver
will always allow himself for a
probable Loss: (which would be the certain
Effect too of making the Valuation
or Silver Coin alterable and uncertain)
that Allowance makes things
bought so much the dearer, and
that Dearness puts a Damp upon
Trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that the Scarcity of Silver is
not only at present too visible, but so
long as the Balance of Trade is lightest
on our Side, is like to be more and more
felt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Yet the great Naval Stores we buy
from abroad, the great Remittances to be
provided for the Subsistence of our
Armies and Fleets, are things inevitable,
and ’tis impossible to hinder the Exportation
of Bullion.</p>

<p class='c000'>But ’tis very easie to hinder the Exportation
of Money.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as we shall do well to consider,
that altho’ our Plate may serve us once
at a dead Lift, as the <i>French</i> King show’d
us the Way, yet it can’t serve us above
once, and when that’s gone after the rest
of our Silver, what are we to do next?</p>

<p class='c000'>We must not only stop a present Gap,
but provide for the future, and so I
lay it down as a Conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>That we are under a very great Want of
Silver Coin to carry on the necessary Trade of
the Kingdom.</i></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h2 id='III' class='c004'>CHAP. III.<br /> <span class='large'><i>Of the Importation of Silver.</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>That which encourages the Importation
of any Commodity is
the Certainty and Quickness of a Market
at a good Price.</p>

<p class='c000'>But notwithstanding Silver is dear
in <i>England</i>, at present we are but dull
Traders for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the <i>Mint</i> and the Silver-Smiths
being the chief Buyers, these cannot
go to Market.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mint cannot afford to buy and
sell to lose; if an Ounce of Silver cost
the Warden of the Mint 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> he
can’t afford to make a Crown-Piece
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>And the fear of Plate’s being call’d
in, to the Disadvantage of the Owner,
puts too great a Damp upon the Silver-Smiths’
Trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the actual calling it in, upon
such Terms, would very little mend
the Matter; People will not be very
fond of buying more, for fear at least
the same Trick should be serv’d ’em
twice.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet our Coin being altogether
insufficient, we must provide for a considerable
Quantity more.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Quantity we want must be imported
according to our Occasions, or
what we have already, be augmented,
by altering the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Species</span></i>, or by coining
out our Plate.</p>

<p class='c000'>It cannot be soon enough imported
in such great Quantities as we at
present want, and yet if we could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>immediately buy it from abroad, we
could not afford to coin what we buy,
without altering our Coin from the old
Standard, seeing our Necessity of having
it, will make its Price rise abroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore I shall refer what I have
more to say, concerning Importation, to
the Chapter of Exportation, and first
speak of altering our Coin, for ’tis evident
we must alter our Coin, as well
as coin our Plate, or otherwise our Plate
will last us but a little while, and in the
mean time we may admit this Conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>That</i> England <i>must be as good a Market
for Silver as other Countries, or
we shall have little imported, be it never so
plentiful abroad</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>There are Three Ways of altering
our Coin.</p>

<p class='c000'>I. <i>First</i>, By not altering the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Species</span></i> of
the Money, but the Value of it, as
making a Crown Piece go for 6 or 7 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i></p>

<p class='c000'>II. <i>Secondly</i>, By diminishing the Matter,
but leaving the same Name, and
there is no essential Difference between
these two Ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>III. <i>Thirdly</i>, by abasing the Fineness
with more than ordinary Allay.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Mr. Lownds’s Report</cite>, p. 28. and onwards.</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>This has been judicially and fully
stated by Mr. <i>Lownd</i>’s, who
hath shown the undeniable
Expediency of keeping up
always our Silver Coin, to the present
Fineness, as that illustrious and solid
Writer Sr. <i>Robert Cotton</i> had likewise
shew’d, and therefore I will say nothing
on this Topic, lest I should seem to
build upon other Mens Foundations; and
I the rather omit it, because all that
hath, or can be said, against the raising
of the extrinsic Valuation of Coin,
above the real Value, is applicable to
the abasing of it by Allay, and I fully
assent to that Axiom, That the debasing
our Money, by Allay, and raising
the Value of the Standard, is only doing
one and the same thing, (to most Intents
and Purposes) by two several
Ways or Means.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose then but two Ways of debasing
it, by Quantity, or by Quality,
and still that is all but <i>debasing</i> of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>that is, giving it a Value in Name, of
more than it hath Intrinsically or Really;
for this more than Intrinsic Value,
is meerly Extrinsical, supposed, or denominated:
in short ’tis a fictitious
imaginary Value, and not a real one,
above the intrinsic.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Cotton’s Posthuma</cite>, p. 287.</div>

<p class='c000'>And this, to say no more of
it, is the reviving of that Monster
which Q. <i>Elizab.</i> of Happy
Memory so gloried in the
subduing; and I doubt we have Monsters
enough to deal with, without reviving
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is such a devouring Expedient
as will immediately swallow down a Part
of every Man’s Estate, and at last consume
the Nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Price of every thing will rise
instead of falling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>For if we were willing to submit to
this at home, yet there is such a Combination,
between our Foreign and
Home Trade, and the Relation between
’em is so inseparable, that let the State
give it what Name it will, it will
pass for no more at home than it doth abroad,
unless the heavy Balance of Trade
was on our side the Water; and it will
pass for no more abroad than it is <i>really</i>,
not <i>Extrinsically</i> or Imaginarily,
worth at home.</p>

<p class='c000'>An Act of Parliament can as well
make a <i>Scotch</i> Pound pass for an <i>English</i>,
as half an Ounce of Silver in
<i>England</i> to go for an Ounce in <i>Holland</i>,
without <i>some Consideration as may Balance
the Difference</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us call a six peny-Weight of Silver
a Crown-Piece, as loud and as long
as we will, yet we shall never buy
a Pound of Nutmegs with Four of
’em, unless you’ll give the <i>Dutch</i> Merchant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>a Yard of broad-Cloth, or something
else into the Bargain.</p>

<p class='c000'>’Tis a plain case, that when the <i>real</i>
Value of Money is lessen’d, the Price
of every thing will Rise accordingly, be
the <i>Extrinsic</i> Value what it will.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two Crown-Pieces do not buy
a Yard of Cloth, because they contain
Ten Shillings, but because they contain
almost two Ounces of Silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gold and Silver are the universal
Pledges and Security of all Trade,
in every Nation, and what’s wanting
in their Value must some way or other
be made Good, more than in Name
or Supposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>’Tis True, in <i>Holland</i> and elsewhere,
they have a base Under-Money, and
there is not an Ounce of Silver, perhaps,
in as many Stivers or Schillings, as are
Equivalent to Ten Shillings in our Money.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>But if in <i>Holland</i>, you can exchange
so many of them, as have not an Ounce
of pure Silver in ’em, for as much of
their better Coin, as contains two or
three Ounces of good Silver, then doubtless
you can buy as good Commodities
for those, as you can proportionably
for their better Money; as here you
might formerly have bought as much
Pack-Thread for 48 Tin Farthings as
for a Silver Shilling; the Reason is, because
there was a recourse; and base
Money will have a proportionable Value
to Good, in that place where it
can be changed into Good; but that’s
a very different thing, from debasing
the whole <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Species</span></i> of Money throughout
the Nation, so that a Man shall be
forc’d always to take Under-Money,
without any prospect of remedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have nothing to say against an inferior
sort of Money; a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verna Nummus</span></i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>provided there be a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regina Pecunia</span></i> too;
and it is indeed a dishonouring him,
whose Image and Superscription our
Money bears, if we shall make use of
our Money to cover over a Fraud;
it is a respect we owe to the King,
not to suffer his Impress upon any
thing but what is really Valuable; and
it is for the Nation’s Honour that the
vilest of our Coin hath a real Value; but
if the Wisdom of the <i>Parliament</i> shou’d
think otherwise, yet there is a vast
Difference between having the under-Money,
and all the Money of the Nation
of an Imaginary Value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Arguments that may be made
use of against such an imaginary Valuation
of Money, are perhaps invincible,
and almost innumerable; but were
there no other but this, I think it might
be sufficient without any more; considering
our present Case.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>We must have an Army in <i>Flanders</i>
or a War in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>I would I had nothing to do but to
make out that.</p>

<p class='c000'>How must we pay this Army? The
Royal Bank of <i>England</i>, ’tis said, have established
there a <i>Mint</i> for Coining of
Money to pay the Army; I desire then
to know if they will be contented to receive
here an undervalued Money, and
pay there our Army in Money which
the <i>Flemmings</i> will take; If they do, the
Cap lies between the <i>Flemmings</i> and them,
I wo’nt award till I know more.</p>

<p class='c000'>I rather think that the <i>Hollanders</i> and
<i>Flemmings</i> will raise their Money proportionably
to what we raise ours, and
then in all Respects we are just as we
were, till we rise higher than they, and
then they higher than we; which will
beget perpetual Wranglings and Wars
in Trade.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>I thought now to have done with
this Article, but can’t omit one thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which is that when you raise the
Value of Money, you Naturally raise
the Value of Silver, which is high enough
already; and then indeed <i>England</i>
will become the Best Market for
Silver, because all Countries will sell
it to us and get sufficiently by the
Bargain: they’ll buy good peny-worths
of our Commodities, giving us high
Valued Silver for it, till we have a
glut of Silver and the Price of Silver falls
and then I suppose the Intrinsic Value of
the Money falls too. Tho’ I confess as
bad Consequences may follow too great
an Intrinsic Value.</p>

<p class='c000'>I speak nothing of the Confusions
and Jealousie which will arise from
hence, but there’s a long Chain of ill
Consequences, and therefore I hope it
will be allow’d as a Maxime.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><i>That if our Silver Coin hath less than
a</i> real Value, <i>it will not answer the Intentions

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='V' class='c004'>CHAP. V.<br /> <span class='large'><i>Of Exportation of Coin’d Silver.</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>’Tis too well known, that when the
Balance of Trade comes to be
examined, we fall short of several of our
Neighbours very considerably: By this
Means the Exchange doth not only fall
very low, but will become altogether insufficient
for our present Occasions; so
that as long as the War continues,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>there is an absolute Necessity that we
export so much Silver and Gold
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in Specie</span></i> as the Balance wants on
our Side.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this Exportation would not be
at all prejudicial to us, if the Importation
could be made equal to the
Exportation, and a Balance in this
Particular only would do our Business.</p>

<p class='c000'>In vain therefore we labour to find
out a Way to force a National Trade
above what the State of <i>Europe</i> in
general, or our own Nation in particular
will allow; if that were not
the Case, where would be the Inconvenience
of a War? This is an Evil
never to be cured, but in Times of
Peace. But our Comfort is, that
even in these Times of War
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>War the Nation notwithstanding
the balance of Trade, appears as
wealthy as ever, excepting only
in the Article of Coyn, so that
it is not only fruitless but very
needless to speak now of the balance
of Trade either in general,
or upon any Article but that of
Money: Besides if we should begin
at that end it would be a round
about way, and so long in compassing,
that we may be at the last
gasp before we attain our end.
He would be accounted no good
Physician who in the case of an
<i>Hæmorrhage</i> when the danger is very
present should talk of Diet Drinks
and Alteratives, whereas an actual
and immediate application to the
part affected, or a sudden revulsion
is more to the purpose. But be the
balance of Trade in general how
it will, ’tis impossible it should
be suddenly remedied, if at all during
the War.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>But if we can balance a little
between that Article of Trade
which relates to the Importation
of Bullion, it will be soon much
better with us than it is at present,
’tis something if we can give present
ease, and not increase the
Danger; and more if we can lessen
the Danger which the want of
ease seems to threaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose for instance then the
whole Trade of <i>England</i> to all
parts of the World to be carried
on by two Merchants, one at <i>London</i>,
and the other at <i>Amsterdam</i>,
and the only Commodities to be
Cloth and Silk. Suppose he at
<i>London</i> Exports every year 1000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>
worth of Broad Cloth and no
more, and he at <i>Amsterdam</i> Imports
hither 1500 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> worth of Silk, that
here’s an inevitable necessity of
the <i>Londiners</i> Exporting every
Year 500 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> in Bullion can’t be denyed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and if this continue year by
year it, will be, you’ll say, of pernicious
consequence to <i>England</i>, and it
will be a wonderful hard matter at
this time to help such a Case.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if we can at present so order
it, that instead of importing
1500 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> worth of Silk we shall import
1000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> worth of Silk, and
500 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> worth of Silver we shall be
no losers in the Article I am upon,
and which is the only thing
I have undertaken to look after,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> That the Nation shall never
want Money be the Trade what
it will: for if 500 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> in Silver be
Exported and as much Imported
every Year, we can never have a
Peny worth of Bullion less than
we have.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if other Nations must get
by us, they had better get any
thing than our Money; if what
they get by us they must be forced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to spend among us, ’twill lessen I
hope the Calamity, as will appear
more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now this is not to be done by
giving our Coyn a <i>Nominal</i>, <i>fictitious</i>
or <i>extrinsick</i> value only above its
intrinsick: Foreigners are not such
Fools to be dealt with at that rate,
as to pay you a Rex Dollar of
18 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> weight 18 grains in <i>Amsterdam</i>
or <i>Brussels</i>, for a piece of
Money of 15 penny weight in
<i>London</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sir <i>Robert Cotton</i>’s answer of the Committee. <i>September 1626.</i> Pag. 306.</div>

<p class='c000'>Turn the Tables, <i>and suppose
the King of</i> Spain <i>should advance
his Real of Eight</i> weighing but
17 Penny Weight 12 Grains

<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Foreign Wares than he can Countervail
by Barter with his own;
he must part with his Money and
not gain by enhauncing his Coyn</i>.
One Real of Eight would not
then buy of us as good a
Yard of broad Cloth as two doth
now, and why should we think
to over reach them more than
they us.</p>

<p class='c000'>But then again, suppose the
Money to be Coyned shall be
(as our Mill’d Money and diminished
hammer’d Money is)
pretty near the Intrinsick value
of the Silver in each piece, and this
will doubtless facilitate Exportation.
If a Foreigner for instance
bring to <i>London</i> and sells 40
Bales of raw Silk, or 40 Tun of
Wine, and meets not here with
such a Market for the buying of
other Commodities to be Transported
as he expected, perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>those he wants are not of our
Growth or Manufacture, or it
may be he is in hast, or the Season
calls him home; how easie is it
for him to sheer away, and go to
another Market, having Money in
his Pocket passable every where, at
the rate he took it, that inconsiderable
allowance for Coynage only
excepted!</p>

<p class='c000'>This I think is plain, but as yet
there is more in it than so; and
suppose it, any other Nations turn
to want Silver as much as we now
do, and Silver should be there at
an higher price than with us, then
our Money becomes good Merchandice,
and he gets most who
carries most over: And the lower
the value of our Coyn is the less
Foreign Commodities we shall have
for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>You’ll Prohibit you’ll say the exporting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of it, and so you have upon
pain of Death prohibited the
Exportation of our Wooll, yet
to the comfort of our Grasiers
’tis still Exported, though it’s very
bulky Ware. But Money lies in
a small Compass, a Sea Captain
knows very little of his chief business
if he knows not where to
stow a 1000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> undiscovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if after all we should be
very severe in the execution of
such prohibitory Laws, it would
put such a damp to Foreign Trade
as every body is not aware of.</p>

<p class='c000'>And indeed if Money were not
allowed to be a commodity, yet ’tis
a Pledge and Surety of every
Traders Property, and I am not
reconciled to the Justice of that
Law which forbids a man to take
his Pledge along with him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Such a Law makes money nothing
but a Commodity, and then
we must pay dear for what we
buy of Foreigners, for most men
will sell Cheaper than they will
Barter.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Article needs I think no

  <h2 id='VI' class='c004'>CHAP. VI.<br /> <span class='large'><i>Of melting down the current Coyn of</i> England <i>by our Goldsmiths and other Artificers</i>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Another great grievance of
the Nation in the matters
of Coyn may be thought the
melting of it down.</p>

<p class='c000'>This hath been a vile and great
practice for many Years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Criminals have been under
two temptations:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The inequality of the Mint
in all the hammered money; some
milled Pieces were of more Intrinsick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>than Extrinsick Value, and some
of less, so that in culling out of
the bigest, they made an evident
advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>But that sort of money being almost
all gone and never like
to be coyned again, I shall altogether
wave the consideration of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The other Temptation is the
great Intrinsick Value of our mill’d
money, most of which was coyn’d
when Silver was 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 2 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 4 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> or
5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> per ounce, and the price of
Silver rising, a Crown piece has
now the intrinsick value of 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i>
or thereabouts, this is a mighty
temptation to melt it down.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Titius</i> owes <i>Sempronius</i> 10 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> and
pays him in mill’d money, <i>Sempronius</i>
owes a third man as much, but
first melts it down and sells it to a
Goldsmith for 12 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> and so puts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>40 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> in his Pocket. This might
have been prevented you’ll say before
all the mill’d money was gone;
by crying down all other money,
for if the Goldsmiths had given
12 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> in mill’d money for an Ingot
melted out of ten Pounds, they
must at length have been ruined;
and therefore the Crying down all
other money must have brought
down the price of Silver necessarily,
or none could have been sold.</p>

<p class='c000'>If 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> melted down would not
have yielded a Crown Piece, who
would have melted ’em; and if
they would have yielded more, the
money of the Nation how much
soever must soon have vanished, for
more could not have been coyn’d,
till the price of Silver should fall: But
how could the price of Silver have
fallen so low in <i>England</i>, as not to
be worth any mans while to melt
down the milled money, if Silver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>should at the same time of its melting
bear an higher price in other
Countries than it did here at the time
of its Coyning: So that the Coyning<a id='t58'></a>
down of base money would at any
time have been so far from helping
us, that it would have immediately
ruined us, it being impossible
to Coyn more upon the old
Standard, if the price of Silver is
higher beyond Sea than it was
when that old Standard was Coyned:
And ’twill be impossible for
us to Coyn new money after the
old Standard (till we can bring
down the Foreign Price of Silver)
so fast as it will be melted down.</p>

<p class='c000'>To make this plain upon which so
much depends, put the Case thus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose you called in by compulsion
and Coyned all the Plate
of <i>England</i>, and suppose it never
so many Millions, and all after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the old Standard, when the Plate
is all gone people will have more
Plate, and Silversmiths must still
have work, and Goldsmiths their
Trade, unless by prohibiting the
use of silver Plate we proclaim an
hypocritical Beggary to all the world,
and ruin many thousand Families
of Artisans. The Silver then of
which you coyn your new Plate
must come from abroad, or be procured
out of your money.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Goldsmith will go the
cheaper way to work, and rather
than he’ll give 5 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 10 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> to a Merchant
for an ounce of Plate, he’ll
fling in a Crown and 6 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> into the
melting Pot, and though the Laws
against melting down Coyn be never
so severe yet people will venture
any thing for gain, as you
may see Clippers do daily; especially
if their Consciences don’t
check ’em, and few mens Consciences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>will scruple making the most
of their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as the accurate Mr. <i>Lowndes</i>
observes, notwithstanding ever
since <i>Ed. 3d</i>’s. time prohibitory Laws
have been against melting down
Coyn, <i>pag.</i> 68. and the profit of
melting it sometimes very inconsiderable,
<i>pag.</i> 69. the practice hitherto
was never prevented. But
it may be said money shall be coyned
of an intrinsick value or near
thereabouts (Coynage only allowed)
in proportion to the present
value of Silver, be it more
or less as it shall alter from time
to time, and so the abatement
for Coynage shall always keep the
Estimate of the Coyn above the
Intrinsick value of the Silver, but instead
of bringing remedy this will
make the Case tentimes worse, for
then upon every rise of Silver the
Goldsmiths and others will melt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>down all that was Coyn’d at a lower
Price, and if the form of the
Coyn don’t direct ’em to be dextrous,
the Prentices shall follow
the old Trade of weighing money
Night and Day too.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that without going farther
upon this Topick, I may lay it
down as a Conclusion or Maxim.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>That if the Intrinsick Value of
Coyn be subject to alteration the
Coyn is always in danger of being
melted down.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Thus our present War with

to many invidious, and to
all visible, and this therefore must
be the cause of all National Calamities.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Whereas many things are better

an almost total desistance from an

brotherly Correspondence with the

<i>Turk</i>. Our King is become the
<i>Generalissimo</i> of <i>Europe</i>, and his

<p class='c000'>These and many more to the
better part of the Nation are the
advantages of this necessary tho’
expensive War.</p>

then the badness of money, and
the scarcity of it, and the Exporting

it, and the rise of Gold, and
the dearness of Commodities, and
the badness of Trade are all as
evident effects of the War as the
Taxes are.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Though in truth this is all Humour
and Caprice, and none of it more
ridiculous than when the hoarding
up of Money is imputed to
the War, which is the meer effect
of the dearness of Silver, as
the dearness of Silver in <i>England</i>
is the natural effect of its dearness
abroad, and its dearness abroad
to the obstructions of Trade,
which would be if only <i>France</i>
and <i>Spain</i> were at War, since <i>Spain</i>
is the Silver Market of the whole
World.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ever since the extraordinary abasement
of Coyn by an unparalleled
Counterfeit and Clipping,
people have hoarded up Money apace,
not knowing how far the
debasement would run; and fearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>if they put their good Money out
they should at the long run be forced
to be paid back in they know not

<p class='c000'>Nor hath the beauty and rarity

of hoarding it up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Undefaced and weighty pieces
are now as so many Medals,
people think it a great happiness
to have a store of ’em. And as
the Coyn degenerates these are
more charily preserved, and will
be so till the intrinsick value of
’em diminishes. I could give a
shrewd guess where this weighty
Money is to be found in great quantities,
but be it where it will as
I said before, I think every man

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Now the <i>Axioms</i> I shall
build upon are chiefly
these.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>AX. I.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'><i>That a way to induce
the Subject to a voluntary
compliance with the
necessities of State, is preferable
to any manner of Compulsion.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>And by this I intend to obviate
two Projects, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i></p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>That the Clipt Money be all
called in without giving full satisfaction
to the Proprietors</i>; and this
I take to be a piece of Injustice,
because this Money was at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>given out to us by the Government,
as a sufficient pledge and
unalterable Security of our Properties,
and it was at first issued
out of the Mint in such
various and undesigned Shapes,
in respect of the Peripherie or Circumference
in which it hath been
debased, and so various withall in
the thickness and weight of each respective
piece, that ’twas almost
impossible for the Subject to distinguish
the diminutions, which at<a id='t73'></a> first
were so Curious, so Subtil, and
small as was not to be easily suspected;
and it hath been by gradual
and sensible approaches that the present
abasements are so considerable.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this cannot be so well urged
in behalf of Counterfeit Money,
it is not any thing we have
received of the State, it never was
given to us, as a Pledge and Security;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and so never was Money
properly so called, but a
False, and Counterfeit sort of
Ware which every man Bartered
for at his own Peril, and to such
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caveat Emptor</span></i> might properly have
been said.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the wisdom of <i>Parliament</i>
things fit to make Compensation
for all the Counterfeit Money, I
have nothing to say against it:
They are the proper Judges.</p>

<p class='c000'>Or if they shall not think fit
to give a full Compensation for the
Clipt Money, I have nothing to
say, it would be great presumption
in a private man to dictate.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the method I shall tender,
I shall make provision for a full
Compensation for all the clipt
and diminished money of the Royal
Standard; at the small expence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of 250.000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> which is vastly less
than I have heard yet proposed,
I reckon three quarters of the money
may be paid back in good Milled
Coyn forthwith, as fast as it
can be coyned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second Project I designed
by the former Axiom to obviate
is,</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The compelling of people to supply
a present exigence by bringing in their
Plate into the Mint</i>:</p>

<p class='c000'>Which would be an attempt I
doubt of pernicious Consequence,
and instead of that I have made a
provision; whereby questionless as
much Plate will be crouded into the
Mint with all the speed imaginable,
as shall make up in tale the two
millions of Pounds Sterling of clipt
money which when melted down
produced but one; and then I presume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the extraordinariness of the
encouragement may, and ought
to Cease.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>AX. II.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'><i>That our coyn cannot be
secured against Exportation,
Melting down, and
Hoarding up, unless it have

<i>value above the</i> intrinsick.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>AX. III.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'><i>That a</i> real <i>value to make

<h3 class='c007'>AX. IV.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'><i>That the</i> real <i>value of Money

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'><i>That Money cannot have a</i>

  <h3 class='c007'>PROPOSITION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'><i>Now I humbly propose to the
Consideration of better judgments
the doing of these things.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>1. The speedy calling in all
the clipt and diminished Money

the calling in the old Money
and issuing out of New.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>3. That therefore vast Encouragement
be given for the speedy bringing
in three or four Millions of ounces
of Plate to the Mint, to answer the
present Necessities of the King and
People.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. That the Exportation of Silver
Money beyond the Permission of the
<i>King</i> and <i>Parliament</i>, be effectually
hinder’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. That a Provision be made as
shall leave no Temptation for the
melting that down which shall be
Coin’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Nor for hoarding it up.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. That the Importation of Silver
from all parts be encouraged, and the
Current Silver-Coin of <i>England</i> encreased
to Five millions of Pounds Sterling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>8. That the Standard, in respect of
Allay, be kept to its old Purity.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. That the Denomination of the

<p class='c000'>10. That every one of the aforesaid
Articles be accomplish’d at no
more expence to the Publick than
Two hundred and fifty thousand
Pounds at present, and a Land-Tax
of a Penny in the Pound during the
War, or, at the most, Two Pence in
the Pound.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>Theorem.</h3>

<p class='c011'>For the effecting all the aforesaid
Articles,</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Let a Competent Authority immediately
Call in and Cry down all Clipt Money under
such a weight, supposing it to be all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>that Money which hath lost full half the
original weight</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This may conveniently and safely
enough be done before any new Money
be coin’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>When this is new Coin’d, let it be re-deliver’d
to the respective Proprietors in proportion,
by Tale, to what every one brought
into the Mint by Tale.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Then let all the rest of the Clipt Money
be Called in by such a Day, and Cry’d
down.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Postulat. 6, 7.</div>

<p class='c000'><i>And supposing in all</i> 2000000 l.
<i>Sterling so melted down, and the
Product, after Melting, be half as much,
or about</i> 3500000 <i>Ounces of Silver, there
may out of this be Coin’d</i> 1250000 l. <i>of
New Money, of the same extrinsick value
it now hath, and of such an intrinsick value,
as that a Crown Piece shall weigh
(now that Silver is</i> 6 s. 6 d. <i>an Ounce,
or</i> 3 l. 18 s. <i>the Pound Troy) Twelve-penny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>weight, and about three grains, and have
in it the intrinsick value of</i> 4 s. <i>So that
the Government hath already saved Two hundred
and fifty thousand Pound</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then will it be known in how
short time 1000000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> can be Coined.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>According to that time, supposing it
(many Mints being set up at once) to be
Two Months, let a Proclamation be issued
out, encouraging the bringing in</i> 4000000
<i>Ounces of Plate into the Mint, at Four
respective Days or Weeks</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>For the first Million, till the end of the
first fortnight, shall be paid</i> 7 s. 4 d.
per <i>Ounce, which amounts to</i> 366666 l.
13 s. 4 d. <i>till the end of the second fortnight,
shall be paid</i> 7 s. 2 d. <i>an ounce,
which comes to</i> 358333 l. 6 s. 8 d. <i>till
the end of the third fortnight, shall be
paid</i> 7 s. <i>an ounce, amounting to</i> 350000 l.
<i>And for the last Million</i> 6 s. 10 d. <i>an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>ounce, amounting to</i> 341666 l. 13 s. 4 d.
<i>in all</i> 1416666 l. 13 s. 4 d. <i>So that for one
ounce with another, the Government has paid</i>
7 s. 1 d. <i>an ounce</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be thought, that a great
deal of this may be saved, and perhaps
Six-pence in an ounce, which
amounts to One hundred thousand
Pounds, and that Six shillings and seven
pence would be Temptation enough,
when the Price of Silver is like to
Fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I am now providing for the
worst Contingences, and the severest
Suppositions that may be.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the Frugalest way, I presume,
would be, to leave the Management
of this Article wholly to the <i>Lords</i>
of the <i>Treasury</i>, who, by publick notice,
may vary <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro re natâ</span></i>, the <i>Præmium</i>
for bringing in Plate, and perhaps may
think it expedient nevertheless to begin
high, and to abate the <i>Præmium</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>according to the quantity brought in;
and after one or two Abatements,
People may perhaps bring it in the
faster, fearing a greater Fall: Whereas
if the <i>Lords</i> of the <i>Treasury</i> should
begin low, and afterwards be forced
to raise the <i>Præmium</i> higher, Peoples
Hopes of their still advancing of it
more, would restrain ’em from making
so much haste as the necessities of
State require.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>We suppose then this Silver to be
Coining every Day as fast as possible, and
that the</i> 250000 l. <i>saved by the Government
out of the first Million, shall begin to
pay for the Plate, as it comes in</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Then three ounces of Silver at</i> 6 s. 8 d.
<i>an ounce, Coins</i> 20 s. <i>of the new Standard,
allowing 2, 3, or 4 d.</i> per <i>ounce for Coinage;
seeing the setting up so many several Mints
more than ordinary must be very chargeable</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>And here must be noted, That let
<i>Silver</i> Rise or Fall as much as it will,
it Alters very little the process of the
<i>Theorem</i>, for it need have no other effects
than making the <i>Money</i> bigger or
less, unless the 3<sup>d</sup> <i>Corolary</i> following be
admitted.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>At this Rate then when 3500000 Ounces
of this Plate is Coin’d into MONEY
it will produce after the aforesaid rate</i>
1166666 l. 13 s. 4 d. <i>to which add the</i>
250000 l. <i>paid before hand for it, and now
there is paid in all for the 4000000
of Ounces of Plate</i> 1416666 l. <i>what it
Cost; and the King hath 500000 Ounces
of Plate by Him, which at</i> 7 s. 1 d. <i>an
Ounce stands the Government in</i> 177088 l.
6 s. 8 d.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>But because it cost the King dear for his
present Necessities, the</i> Lords <i>of the</i> Treasury
<i>cannot allow more for it than it will produce
when Coin’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>And if the necessities of State require
that this Silver should be sent
and Coin’d in <i>Flanders</i>, that it may go
farther there than it can here for the
immediate use of the Souldiers, then
the Commissioners of the Accounts will
probably account for it, according to
its Value beyond Sea; and then the Government
shall still be a greater Loser
by it; so the <i>Lords</i> of the <i>Treasury</i> cannot
allow for it more perhaps than
150000 l. what ever it be more or less,
the case will stand thus at the least.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>There is now of New Money Coin’d</i>,
2416666 l. 13 s. 4 d. <i>and this last</i>
150000 l. <i>being advanced to the King
for his present Necessities abroad, either
to Coin in</i> Flanders, <i>or to send over
in Bills, will go towards the payment of the
Million of Clipt money. But if it be probable
as Mr.</i> Lounds <i>seems to intimate,
That People may Voluntarily bring in a great
deal of Plate at</i> 6s. 6d. <i>an Ounce; then
it is much more probable, that they will be
quicker in bringing it in at</i> 6 s. 7 d. <i>an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>ounce; and if so, the Government Saves out
of my Proposals</i> 6 d. <i>an Ounce, which in</i>
4000000 <i>Ounces comes to</i> 100000 l. <i>And
then there will be</i> 250000 l. <i>paid in recompence
of the Clipt Money, and there is but</i>
750000 l. <i>Remaining</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Or put the case Shorter and Plainer,
the Government wants 1000000 l.
worth of Silver, and is willing to give
25 <i>per Cent.</i> more for it than the common
price.</p>

<p class='c000'>If that vast Allowance be made for
fear of a sudden and fatal stop to all
manner of Trade for want of Money,
yet the 250000 l. Saved out of the
Clipt Money, will make good the
Bargain.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then Four parts in Five will
Coin a Million of Money, and still
there will be another 250000 l. worth
left towards the paying of the Clipt
Million, and but 750000 l. remains
Unpaid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>And upon this Easier supposition
we will proceed; because it is likewise
cheaper to the Nation than the Buying
of full 4000000 ounces of Silver.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Then if the Parliament Orders ’em to
be paid</i> 250000 l. <i>more, which is all that
the Nation is Burdened in the Bargain:
The Proprietors of the Clipt Money are
Reimbursed</i> 75 l. per Cent. <i>of what they
Brought to the Mint, which is more by</i> 25 l.
per Cent. <i>than the intrinsick value of
it was; and the other</i> 25 l. per Cent. <i>is
coming towards ’em apace. For now the present
Necessity and the Dangers of it are obviated,
the price of Silver begins to Fall
and Settle, as the prospect of a Plenty draws
nearer</i>; tho’ we can never suppose it will
fall lower than in other Countries, or
much lower at all, during the War between
<i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i>. <i>And be it at what
price it will, the Merchant will from all Parts
bring his Silver to the</i> Tower, <i>because the
Market is here Quick and he is sure of Ready-Money
for what he Sells; the King can afford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>now to Coin, which he could not do of
late Years; And therefore a Third and Fourth
Million will be soon bought and Coined, and
the government out of every Million bought
will save a Fourth part</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>For the New-Coin’d Money must bear a
proportion to the price of Silver, as four to
five, and</i> 800000 l. <i>worth of Silver is to
be in</i> 1000000 l. <i>of New Coin no more nor
less, and out of the four Million-worth of
Silver, besides the Million of Plate the King
will have Saved a fifth Million; by which
gain’d Millions, the Clipt Money will be entirely
Satisfied for at no more than</i> 250000 l.
<i>present Cost to the Government</i>, q. e. d.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the case will stand thus: There
will be 5000000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> of New Coin, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>
out of the Clipt Money 1250000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> out
of the Plate 1250000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> (or if the last
250000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> be not Coin’d, but Exported,
then there will be out of the Plate but
1000000 l.) and out of the last Two
Million worth of <em class='gesperrt'>SILVER</em> Coin’d
2500000 l. So that there will be in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Nation at least Four Millions, Seven
Hundred, and Fifty Thousand Pounds
New Money.</p>

<p class='c000'>The King, after all this, buys
750000 Ounces of <i>Bullion</i>, and coins
it, without Profit, into 250000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> This
makes up 5000000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> compleat, and
then the Royal Mints is to be at a stand
(as at present) until the Parliament
shall have resolved what more is to
be done; our present Necessities are
supply’d, and this, which we shall
have, will not be diminished.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Five Millions now want a
fifth part of the <i>Intrinsick Value</i> of the
Coin; and unless a <i>Real Value</i> be given
it to make amends for the want of
the <i>Intrinsick</i>, and to Equal the <i>Extrinsick</i>,
I have, after all, I confess, done
nothing, according to my Fourth
<i>Axiom</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><i>I humbly therefore Propose, That a Land-Tax
may make it good, if it do not exceed
Two-pence in the Pound.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>But after what manner it is to be
made good, is the great Question.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they, into whose Hands the newcoin’d
Silver shall first come, should
be allowed for the Intrinsick Want of
it, then, in the paying it out again
they must transmit the Allowance
the State gives; or else the First Receivers
would be Savers, and the rest
Losers: But if the State must immediately
give the Full Allowance, then
it might as well have Coin’d to the
<i>full Intrinsick Value</i>. But the <i>Intrinsick
Value</i> is lessen’d, and the <i>Real</i> given,
because the Government is better
qualified at present to pay <i>Interest</i> than
<i>Principal</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Therefore an</i> Interest <i>is to be paid equivalent
to the Extrinsick Value, and fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>satisfactory for the Want of Intrinsick; that
so the Subject may be no Loser, and the
Government put to no Difficulties</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beside, that Money would return
to its Intrinsick Value, if a <i>Shilling</i>
were always to be tack’d to a <i>Crown</i> or
<i>Four-Shilling</i> Piece; which is One of
the chief things we are to avoid.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Let this Interest be</i> 5 <i>per Cent.</i> and let
it be look’d upon as a sufficient Interest,
as it better will appear to be,
when I come to answer the Objections,
which may be made to this Method.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The Interest of a Million of Pounds
Sterling, which is wanting to make up the
Real Value of the New Coin at</i> 5 per
Cent. <i>amounts to Fifty thousand Pounds</i>
per Annum.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>But, to Ease the Nation of half this
Charge, let it be duly and carefully considered,</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><i>That if the present Possessor of an entire</i>
100 l. <i>be entitled to this Interest, and
not of a less Sum, every less Sum will have
such a Value Real, as the Possessor of an
entire</i> 100 l. <i>can make of it, and will allow
for it</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>And there will be no occasion for the
Government to pay Interest for lesser Sums,
because the valuation of lesser Sums will
always bear that proportion which Merchants,
Goldsmiths, and Bankers will receive
’em at, from the least Sum to the
greatest.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>If I pay in, for instance, to a
Goldsmith Fifty pounds to day, and
Fifty pounds to morrow, he will no
more scruple to give me a Note for
One hundred pounds, than if I had paid
it in at once: And, if I pay my
Brewer Five pounds a week, as he
brings in my Drink, for twenty weeks
together, he will look upon it as good
Pay as if I paid him at the twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>weeks end One hundred pounds together;
and if Five pounds will pass
from me as the <i>fifth part</i> of an <i>Hundred</i>,
why not, by the same Rule of Proportion
20 Shillings for the <i>hundredth part</i>? That
which hath the Value of Five pound
<i>Lumbard-street</i>, hath the same in <i>Pater-Noster-Row</i>,
and the same likewise at
<i>Brentford</i>, or elsewhere: And there can
be no Instance or Reason given, why
Money of the like weight; Intrinsick
and Extrinsick Value, should not be
as passable in little Sums as in great,
since there is an easie Resort, and at
hand always; in which, without any
distinction, they daily determine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where an Hundred pound will be
Received, there will Ninety nine, and
Ninety eight, and so downwards (for,
where can you stop?) to the single
Penny.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span><i>And of the Running Cash of</i> England
<i>we may reasonably suppose, that one half is
not in Sums exceeding Twenty Pounds, and
they who have less Sums than that, will
have no great Encouragement to look after
Interest</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fifth Part which Twenty Pound
wants of its Intrinsick Value, is but
Four Pounds, and that, at 5 <i>per Cent.</i> is
but Four Shillings a Year; from which
the trouble of Receiving by entering
into Combination with others, will
for the most part take off, and not
make it worth the while.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>So that the whole</i> Money <i>of</i> England,
<i>that is New Coin’d, not amounting to
above</i> 5000000 <i>l. and but half that to
be paid Interest for</i>, viz. 2500000 l. <i>and
there wanting but a Fifth Part of that</i>,
viz. 500000 l. <i>the Interest of</i> 500000 l.
<i>at</i> 5 per Cent. <i>amounts to just</i> 25000 l.
per Annum.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><i>But then, supposing that Interest be demanded
for</i> ⅗ <i>of the New-coin’d Money,
and that by an unexpected Combination every
Sum of Five Pounds should be brought in,
yet then the whole Interest amounts to no
more than</i> 30000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> per Annum.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the Case stands thus:</p>

<p class='c000'>The Parliament hath Borrow’d of
the whole People of <i>England</i> a Million
of Pounds Sterling, and no more,
to be repay’d at the end of the
War; and in the mean time, till it
be repay’d, they give Five Pounds
<i>per Cent.</i> Interest upon a Land-Tax.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus <i>the Clipp’d Money is all Call’d
in, and Satisfied for; there hath been little
time between Calling back of the Old,
and Paying back the New, by bringing
in</i> 1000000 <i>l. worth of Plate speedily
and voluntarily into the</i> Mint, <i>an
effectual Stop is put to the Exportation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>melting down, and hoarding up of Coin’d
Money; Importation of Silver from all
Parts Encourag’d, the Current Coin of</i>
<em class='gesperrt'>ENGLAND</em> <i>Encreas’d; the Purity
and Denomination of the Coin Continued;
and all at the present Expence of Two
hundred and fifty thousand Pounds, and
a Yearly Land-Tax of One Penny in the
Pound during the War</i>, q. e. d.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only Difficulty that remains,
is, After what manner the Interest
shall be paid.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, if there is no more than
<i>Difficulty</i> in it, I desire it may be
Consider’d, What Great Difficulties
the People of <em class='gesperrt'><i>ENGLAND</i></em>
at present undergo, in the Want of
such a Regulation: What Difficulties
are in every Market-Shop, and
House of Trade; and what Great
Disorders are Daily like to ensue:
Let Bankers, Goldsmiths, Merchants,
and Cash-keepers, consider the Difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>they lye under at present,
and the much greater Disadvantages
they must be subject to, if the Coin
of <i>England</i> should not have a <i>Real</i>
Value.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, to make the Difficulty seem
much less than may at First be imagin’d,
I humbly propose this following
Method.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Let the Days of its Payment be fix’d
by</i> <em class='gesperrt'>PARLIAMENT</em>, <i>either Quarterly,
Annually, or Triennially. If the
Establish’d Interest be Five Pounds</i> per
Cent. <i>then, perhaps, Annually will be
thought most expedient, in some Month
when the Days are long. If the Wisdom
of</i> Parliament <i>shall think fit to give more
Interest than Five Pounds</i> per Cent. <i>then
there is Visible Reason, why it should be
Quarterly. If less than Five Pounds</i> per
Cent. <i>a Triennial Payment may suffice</i>.
But suppose it Yearly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><i>Let Three hundred Commissioners be named
by</i> Parliament, <i>One hundred of
which for</i> London, Westminster, <i>and</i>
Southwark, <i>the Two hundred for the
Country, to be not above Twenty Miles
distant from one another, so that no body
can live farther off than Ten Miles from
one Commissioner or other</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Let these Commissioners be the most
Substantial Gentlemen or Citizens in the
most Popular Towns and Cities in</i> England,
<i>giving in sufficient Security to the
Government for Performance of Their
Trust</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>At the Day appointed let the Money
be brought to the Commissioners Houses
in Hundred-pound Baggs, and there open’d
and weigh’d, and then seal’d up with the
Proprietor’s Seal, in the presence of the
said Commissioner, Entering down in a
Register every man’s Name in one Column,
the Weight of the Money in another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Column, and the Interest it amounts
to in a third.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Let none be Receiv’d after Twelve of
the Clock at Noon, and none Re-delivered
till One of the Clock, to prevent Frauds
in bringing the same Money twice for the
same Interest.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Then, in the Afternoon, let every man’s
proper and individual</i> Money, <i>Seal’d up
as aforesaid, and Weighed again in the
sight of the Proprietor, be deliver’d, with
the</i> Interest <i>due for it</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>For which One Days Trouble in a Year,
I do suppose, the Government may allow
the Commissioners Twenty Pound a man;
which amounting to Six thousand Pounds</i>
per Annum, <i>for all the Commissioners of</i>
<em class='gesperrt'>ENGLAND</em>, <i>and suppose Three of
the Five millions, whereas I supposed at
first</i> 2500000 <i>l. only to demand Interest,
it will amount to but Thirty thousand
Pounds</i> per Annum, <i>and this Six thousand
Pounds</i> per Annum <i>for the Commissioners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>added, makes but Six and thirty
thousand Pounds</i> per Annum.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Now, whereas a Land-Tax of Four
Shillings in the Pound amounts to</i> 2000000 <i>l.
a Tax of a Penny in the Pound amounts
to</i> 41666 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> 13 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 4 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span> so that</i>

<p class='c000'><i>Allow the Commissioners then Thirty
Pounds apiece, and there remains</i> 2666 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>
13 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 4 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span> for a Superintendant, Auditors,
Registers, Register-Books, and other incident
Charges; and the whole matter is
brought within a Tax of a Penny in the
Pound</i>, q. e. d.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, as to the Hoarded Money,
the Mill’d and Hammered Money of
Full Weight, I humbly am of the
Opinion, That no Notice at all be
taken of it by the Government; and
my Reasons are: That it will have
an uncertain Value, according to Peoples
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Opinion; and, that Uncertainty
of Estimation, as well as the Intrinsick
Value, will cause it, without
any Edict or Precept, to be melted
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>For, a great deal of it is now kept
up, only to see what things will
come to; and what Advantage can
be made of it: But when People
see the Parliament has Conquer’d the
Difficulty, and that there is a great
Plenty of Money stirring about again,
they will be baulk’d of their Expectations,
and take Advantage of the
First of the Market; this will conduce
to the Cheapness of Bullion,
and cause a Plenty: And if any continue
still hoarded, it will be by
People only who have an irremediable
Humour that way; and ’tis better
they should hoard that for which
the Government pays no Interest,
than to keep Unemploy’d Money by
’em at the expence of the Publick.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>And as to the Paying of our Armies
Abroad, I humbly propose,
That the <i>Parliament</i> may always give
His Majesty such an Allowance for
that Use, as His Majesty may be
enabled to Export so much Uncoin’d
Silver as is necessary to the carrying
on of so Glorious a War.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which Uncoin’d Silver will for the
most part find its way back again, because
the carrying over so much every
Year will glut that place to which
’tis carryed; so that Silver will become
Cheap there, and they must
disgorge at the best Market; which
<i>England</i>, in all probability, will be.
And the effect of that Over-ballance
which Forreigners must, as cases now
stand, get by us; cannot be carryed
out of the Nation, but in other Commodities
besides Silver.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>For Silver Uncoin’d they Sell, and
Silver Coin’d they cannot afford to
carry away; So that our own Commodities
are like to be bartered for
Silver, and that conduces to bring the
ballance of Trade even.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here I go no farther, but leave
the Question to better Understandings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quest. <i>Whether Silver bearing
an higher Price here than elsewhere,
and coming to a Quicker
Market, will not naturally and
easily force an Exportation of our
own Commodities, when it shall become
altogether impracticable to
Export our Coin?</i></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>Corol. I.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Note</b>, That the Price of Silver
Bullion being subject to Vary, the
difference between the <i>Intrinsick</i>, and
the <i>Real</i> Value, ought to be Considerable;
Because, if they should be
too near one another, the Additional
Value would be so Small, that when
Silver Rises, the Goldsmiths would be
Tempted to Melt down the New
Coin, when they can get almost as
Much by that Practice, as they can
do by receiving Interest, or by passing
it away for Principal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor must the Two several Values
be too far Different one from the other,
lest Foreigners be Tempted to Counterfeit
our Coin.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>I don’t mean by sending Us over
such a Counterfeit as shall be of Less
intrinsick Value than our Own; but
they can Afford all the Charge of
Curious Coinage, and Pure Silver,
and Full Weight, and Hazard of Importing
it contrary to all Laws that
We can Make; If any more considerable
Sum, than Twenty <i>per Cent.</i>
could be Gain’d by such Importation:
But no body can afford all the Charge
and Hazard, if the Profit be no Greater,
and the Punishment Capital.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>Corol. II.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, provision may be
Made, that all <i>Counterfeit Money</i> shall
be Confiscated by a Summary Process,
to be Tryed by a Jury of <i>Moneyers</i>,
for every Sum above <i>Five Pounds</i>;
and for Less Sums, able and substantial
<i>Goldsmiths</i> shall be Commissioned
and Authorised to end Disputes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Cutting it Asunder before the Owners
Face; and Charging themselves in a
Book kept for that purpose, as Debters
to the King for the same individual
pieces, which at the General Quarter
Sessions they shall deliver for the
<em class='gesperrt'>KING</em>’s Use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some such Method as This, would
make people more Cautious in taking
Counterfeit Money; whereas now they
Take what they themselves Know to
be so, which hath given great Encouragement
to Counterfeiters.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if I may be Well Heard, I
don’t at all Question, but to shew a
Way; how all Counterfeit Money may
be easily Known; let it be Wash’d,
Plated; of mixt Metal, or pure Silver;
Which is the next piece of Service of
this Nature, that I designe my Country,
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> continuing my Life and
Health.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>Corol. III.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I humbly Propound to the Disquisition
of Better Judgments; Whether
the New Coin ought not alwayes to
be of the same continued Weight, notwithstanding
any Variations in the
Price of Bullion; and that not the
Weight of Coin, but the Aforementioned
Interest be Varied from Year
to Year according to the Price of
Bullion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Advantages and Conveniences
of what I have Proposed, is, I hope,
by this time, somewhat Evident; but
before I Reckon ’em up, it may perhaps
be Expected that I should Faithfully
and Candidly let down all those
<i>Objections</i> which have Occurr’d to me
whilst I have been Writing these Papers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>The most Material I will: And
they are These.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Object.</i> I.</h3>

<p class='c012'><i>Now, if it be Objected, that
Five Pounds</i> per Cent. <i>for
want of</i> Silver, <i>in an Hundred
Pound is too little, seeing an
Hundred Pound Bagg-full is
entitled to no more than Twenty
Shillings a Year</i>:</p>

<p class='c013'>I Answer,</p>

<p class='c000'>That if a Man be contented to
put in his Money into any of
the New Banks, at 3 <i>l. per Cent.</i> ’tis
better worth to lend it at 5 <i>per Cent.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per Annum</span></i>, upon as good Security.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>If it be reply’d, That a Man may
take it out of a Bank when he will,
and his Money is always at Command:
I answer, It is much more so
when he has it in his own Custody;
For, he who shall have Four hundred
Crown-pieces by him, can make as
much use of it to all Intents and
Purposes, but of Melting or Exporting,
as if it were of an Intrinsick
Value; and then sure he who having
Four hundred Pieces of Money
by him of a Real Worth, and applicable
to any Lawful Use, can
make Twenty Shillings a Year Advantage
by Keeping ’em; hath much
the better of him who hath Four
hundred Pieces of other Money by
him, of no more <i>Real</i> Value, nor
more transferable, and hath no Profit
by ’em, whilst they are in his
Hands.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>And whereas it may be said, <i>No
Man can be entitled to the Interest of that</i>
20 l. <i>due to him from the Government, unless
he keeps</i> 80 <i>more dead by him, as a Vehicle
to convey the Interest of the</i> 20 l. <i>to
him</i>. I answer the Government doth
not intend to give Encouragement
that Men should keep more Money
by ’em than they have, or may have
Occasion for.</p>

<p class='c000'>That is a sort of hoarding which we
are to prevent.</p>

<p class='c000'>And therefore this 5 <i>l. per Cent.</i> is not
given as an Interest for dead and unemploy’d
Money, but to ascertain universally
the real Value of it, and to
take off all the Objections that are
made against a mere extrinsick Value.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the Wisdom of the <i>Parliament</i>
thinks fit to give 10 <i>l. per Cent.</i> Interest,
whereby every 100 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> of new Coin’d
Money will be entitled to 40 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span> per
Annum</i> Interest; then the whole Interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of 500000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> which the 2500000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>
half of the 5000000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> wants of intrinsick
Value, amounts at 10 <i>l. per Cent.</i> but
to 50000 <i>l. per Annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Or suppose by Combination ⅗ of the
5000000 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> demand Interest, then will
the whole Interest amount to but
60000 <i>l. per Annum</i>, which with all the
incident Charges, will be defrayed for
little more than a Three-half-penny in
the Pound Land-Tax; and for much
less than 2 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> in the Pound.</p>

<p class='c000'>And I am not at all against an Interest
of 10 <i>l. per Cent.</i> because beside the
present Advantage it gives, it doth
ascertain to the People of <i>England</i>, not
only a Promise that the <i>Parliament</i> will;
but that there is a reason of good Husbandry
likewise, why the Parliament
should as soon as possible save the Nation
that Annual Charge, by the paying
of the principal Million that is wanting.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Answ.</i> Less will not secure it against

<p class='c000'>Foreigners have a knack at raising
the price of Silver to draw over our
Money to ’em; and I hear they can afford
what they now daily do, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> To
Export, rather than fail, Clipt Money;
and the only way to keep our Money
at Home, <i>Is to fix, during the War,
one considerable part of its Value to the
Kingdom</i>; and when those Foreigners
who must deal with us, cannot
Export our Money, but with great disadvantage,
they will be forced to take
our Commodities in lieu of it, and be
as industrious to make ’em valuable abroad
as we are. And as to that Notion
that we must not glut the Markets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>abroad with our Commodities, it is a
Vulgar Errour unless we make this distinction,
That ’tis dangerous when our
<i>English</i> Factories glut the Market; for
when Foreigners see the Market full,
they combine together to keep down
the Price, knowing that we must Sell;
but then Foreigners who are better acquainted
with their own Markets and
Fairs than we are, and can spread a
Trade much farther than our Factories
can do, when they Export our Commodities
and cannot Trade at all with
us without exporting ’em; they can
shift from one place to another, and
open secret Passages of Commerce, not
yet found out.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the <i>Portugueses</i> for instance could
not have Money for their Wine, would
they (I desire to know) rather leave
of Trading with us, than take our Cloth

had drank no <i>French</i> Wine, but what
we had paid for in Tin, would they

all, to our disadvantage, here’s nothing
in all this matter that hinders our exporting
Bullion.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if ’tis absolutely necessary to export
Bullion to make good the Ballance
of Trade, then we should take the
more care, not to export more than is
absolutely necessary; and whilst we
carry on our Trade abroad, not to let
this at home be at a stand, but secure
Money enough for the Nations In-land
Trade, and to pay the Taxes without

<p class='c000'>But we are providing for a present
necessity and not abundance.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet should we Coin five Millions
more, in all Ten Millions; less
than 2 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> in the Pound Land-Tax,
would pay Interest for all, and the
Million gained out of it would save 2 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i>
in the Pound that Year, which is making
a very good Bargain for the Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>But you may vary the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Postulata</span></i>, as I
said before, how you please.</p>

to the Eye.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Answ.</i> Go which way you will, it
must be smaller than it was, or of
greater value, because Bullion is dearer
than when the Mill’d Money was
Coin’d, and if the new Coin’d Money
were to have an Intrinsick Value, it
must necessarily be ⅕ less than it now is,
and according to these Proposals it will
be but about ⅓.</p>

<p class='c000'>Supposing Silver at this extraordinary
Price, I don’t see how it can possibly
be larger than as 8 to 10, and this

<p class='c005'>1. <span class='xxlarge'>T</span>he Subject will be assured by
the giving intire Satisfaction
for Clipt Money, that the Coin of <i>England</i>
Minted by Authority, is an inviolable
and an unalterable Property which
the <i>Parliament</i> will for ever maintain,
even in the worst of times; the Consideration
of which, will give the real
and additional Value of the new Coin’d
Money, a Credit throughout the World.
And People will be the better able to
pay Taxes if they are at no loss by their
Clipt Money.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>2. The Denomination of the Silver
Coin will not hereby be raised above
the real value.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The Trade and Circulation of
Bullion in and out of the Kingdom,
will not be at all hinder’d, so that as
much Silver and Gold may be yearly
transported into <i>Flanders</i>, as the occasions
of the War require, without loss of
Coinage; and Money which is the Vital
warmth of In-land Trade, by which
People are enabled to pay Taxes, always
preserved among us.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The frequent Rises and Falls of
Money beyond Sea, will be no longer
an effectual trick to cheat us, as it hath
hitherto been.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. If it should after all be exported,
it will be 20 <i>l. per Cent.</i> more to the
Exporters loss, than if it had a full Intrinsick
Value.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. That 20 <i>l. per Cent.</i> which the Exporters
lose, will be gain’d by the Government;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>because for what is exported,
no Interest will be paid, nor no
Principal at the end of the War.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. The Coin’d Silver of the whole
Nation, may in times of Peace be reduced
to the old Standard, and Intrinsick
Value, without recoining or altering
the Species.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Those who hide and hoard up
their Money, to defeat the Intents of a
<i>Tax</i> upon it, will be disappointed of
their Ends, and become greater Losers
than by producing it; whereby Money
may be affected by <i>Taxes</i>, which
now cannot so easily be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. All the Benefits and Advantages
which can be proposed by a raising of
the extrinsick and denominated Value
of Money, will be hereby secured,

<p class='c000'>10. All the Advantages which can be
proposed to the Publick by Coining

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
